            <p>Code Explanation:
                - The parent element (.Parent) has a margin of 500 pixels, and the child element (.Child) has a margin of 300 pixels.
                - Instead of having a total distance of 800 pixels (500 + 300), only the largest margin (500 pixels) is applied. Therefore, the space between the parent and child will be 500 pixels.</p>
